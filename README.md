`Ultimate Member Hooyu` is a plugin to integrate [Ultimate Member](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/) with the [HooYu ID Verfication service](https://www.hooyu.com/).

It is based on Tom McFarlin's `wp_remote_post_example` as a starting point. `wp_remote_post_example` is a simple plugin used to demonstrate how to take advantage of the WordPress HTTP API for submitting post requests. The original plugin was used as part of the [A Look at the WordPress HTTP API](http://wp.tutsplus.com/series/a-look-at-the-wordpress-http-api/) series on [WPTuts+](http://wp.tutsplus.com/).

## Description
